# tower of hanoi

## Quick Start

1. `git clone https://github.com/adam-r-kowalski/tower-of-hanoi.git`
2. `cd tower-of-hanoi`
3. `cmake CMakeLists.txt`
4. `make`
5. `./toh`

## Usage

Once the program is loaded you have a few options as to how to solve the problem

- By Yourself:          for this option type 1
- Iteratively:          for this option type 2
- Recursively:          for this option type 3
- Mutually Recursively: for this option type 4
- Change Disk Count:    for this option type 5

## Change Disk Count

By default the tower has only 3 disks, so that it is relatively simple
to solve by yourself. If you would like a challange you can increase
the number of disks to whatever you like. If you get stuck try running one
of the algorithms to see how to do it.
